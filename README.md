## Basic layout of an automated home monitoring system using a variety of open standards

### Goal:

> To create an automated store of snapshots and video from a home ip cam, which can be accessed from the web on any authorized client.


### Roadmap:

~~Mount Onvif ready IP Camera using 802.3at standard~~

~~Connect to the camera from a node server~~

~~Take snapshots from the camera and store them on an intermediary location~~

Create a local storage on my home network to store these snapshots
